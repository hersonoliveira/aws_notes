# Dynamo DB

* Managed NoSQL DB
* Fault tolerant design distributed across AZs
* Access through API, no JDBC/ODBC
* **No** security groups with DynamoDB
* Each region is independent and isolated from other regions

* **Local secondary index** - Same partition key, different sort key
* **Global secondary index** - Different partition key and sort key

* DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) - in-memory cache

* Keeping data together is a basic characteristic of a NoSQL database such as Amazon DynamoDB. Keeping related data in proximity has a major impact on cost and performance. Instead of distributing related data items across multiple tables, keep related items in your NoSQL system as close together as possible

## Read consistency

* Eventually Consistent Reads (default)
    - Response might include old data

* Strongly Consistent Reads
    - Returns the most up-to-date data

## Read/Write capacity mode

* On-Demand
    - Pay only for what you use

* Provisioned(default, free-tier)
    - Specify reads/writes per second required for the application 

## Replication

Replicate a table to be available on another region

## Streams and AWS Lambda triggers

Amazon DynamoDB is integrated with AWS Lambda so that you can create triggersâ€”pieces of code that automatically respond to events in DynamoDB Streams. With triggers, you can build applications that react to data modifications in DynamoDB tables

When Streams is enabled in a table, it records information about every modification to data items in the table.

## DynamoDB Local

DynamoDB Local is the downloadable version of DynamoDB that enables you to write and test applications without accessing the web service.

## DynamoDB transactions

With Amazon DynamoDB transactions, you can group multiple actions together and submit them as a single all-or-nothing **TransactWriteItems** or **TransactGetItems** operation
