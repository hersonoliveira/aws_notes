# Dynamo DB

* Managed NoSQL DB
* Fault tolerant design distributed across AZs
* Access through API, no JDBC/ODBC
* **No** security groups with DynamoDB
* Each region is independent and isolated from other regions

## Read consistency

* Eventually Consistent Reads (default)
    - Response might include old data

* Strongly Consistent Reads
    - Returns the most up-to-date data

## Read/Write capacity mode

* On-Demand
    - Pay only for what you use

* Provisioned(default, free-tier)
    - Specify reads/writes per second required for the application 

## Replication

Replicate a table to be available on another region

## Streams and AWS Lambda triggers

Amazon DynamoDB is integrated with AWS Lambda so that you can create triggersâ€”pieces of code that automatically respond to events in DynamoDB Streams. With triggers, you can build applications that react to data modifications in DynamoDB tables
