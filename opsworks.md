# AWS OpsWorks

* Manage your applications as a stack containing different layers such as load balancing, database and application servers
* AWS OpsWorks Stacks uses Chef recipes to deploy and configure software components on Amazon EC2 instances

* AWS OpsWorks Stacks issues a configure lifecycle event on all instances in a stack any time a single instance goes offline or comes online. This is so that all instances in a stack can be made “aware” of the instance’s status.
