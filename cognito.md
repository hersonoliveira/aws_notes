# AWS Cognito

* Amazon Cognito lets you add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily
* With Amazon Cognito, you can create user pools to store user profile information and store attributes such as user name, phone number, address, and so on

## Cognito Identity Pools

You can use Identity pools to grant your users access to other AWS services. With an identity pool, your users can obtain **temporary AWS credentials** to access AWS services, such as Amazon S3 and DynamoDB

## Cognito User Pools

After successful authentication, Amazon Cognito returns user pool **tokens** to your app. You can use the tokens to grant your users access to your own server-side resources, or to the Amazon API Gateway
