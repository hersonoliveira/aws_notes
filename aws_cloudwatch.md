# Amazon CloudWatch

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS Cloud resources and the applications that you run on AWS. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, set alarms, and automatically react to changes in your AWS resources.

You can use CloudWatch to detect anomalous behavior in your environments, set alarms, visualize logs and metrics side by side, take automated actions, troubleshoot issues, and discover insights to keep your applications running smoothly.

* CloudWatch does **not** agreggate data across regions
* Amazon CloudWatch alarms changes to a state other than **INSUFFICIENT_DATA** only when the alarm resource has had sufficient time to initialize and there is sufficient data available for the specified metric and period
