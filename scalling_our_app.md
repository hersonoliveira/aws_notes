## Elastic Load Balancing

Automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses. It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones.

### Application Load Balancer

Operates at the request level (Layer 7), routing traffic to targets--such as EC2 instances, microservices and containers--within Amazon VPC, based on the content of the request. It's ideal for the advanced load balancing of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Secure HTTP (HTTPS) traffic.

### Network Load Balancer

Operates at the connection level (Layer 4), routing connections to targets--such as Amazon EC2 instances, microservices, and containers--within Amazon VPC, based on IP protocol data. It's ideal for load-balancing Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) traffic.

### Classic Load Balancer

Provides basic load balancing across multiple Amazon EC2 instances, and it operates at both the request level and the connection level.

## Auto Scaling

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability, and it allows you to dynamically scale your Amazon EC2 capacity up or down automatically according to conditions that you define. You can use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling for fleet management of Amazon EC2 instances, which can help maintain the health and availability of your fleet, and ensure that you are running your desired number of Amazon EC2 instances. You can also use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to dynamically scale Amazon EC2 instances. Dynamic scaling automatically increases the number of Amazon EC2 instances during demand spikes to maintain performance and decrease capacity during lulls, which can help reduce costs. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling is well-suited to applications that have stable demand patterns, or applications that experience hourly, daily, or weekly variability in usage.
