# Policy Types

- **AWS Organizations Service Control Policy (SCP)** â€“ Use an AWS Organizations Service Control Policy (SCP) to define the maximum permissions for account members of an organization or organizational unit (OU). SCPs limit permissions that identity-based policies or resource-based policies grant to entities (users or roles) within the account, but do not grant permissions.

- **Permissions boundary** - Permissions boundary is a managed policy that is used for an IAM entity (user or role). The policy defines the maximum permissions that the identity-based policies can grant to an entity, but does not grant permissions.

- **Access control list (ACL)** - Use ACLs to control which principals in other accounts can access the resource to which the ACL is attached. ACLs are similar to resource-based policies, although they are the only policy type that does not use the JSON policy document structure. ACLs are cross-account permissions policies that grant permissions to the specified principal.

- **Resource-based policy** - Resource-based policies grant permissions to the principal that is specified in the policy. Principals can be in the same account as the resource or in other accounts. The most common examples of resource-based policies are Amazon S3 bucket policies and IAM role trust policies.

- **Identity-based policy** - Help attach managed and inline policies to IAM identities (users, groups to which users belong, or roles). Identity-based policies grant permissions to an identity.
