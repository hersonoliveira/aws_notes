# AWS Encryption SDK

The AWS Encryption SDK is a client-side library designed to streamline data security operations so that customers can follow encryption best practices. It supports the management of data keys, encryption and decryption activities, and the storage of encrypted data.

* Generates, encrypts, and decrypts data keys
* Uses the data keys to encrypt and decrypt your raw data
* Stores the encrypted data keys with the corresponding encrypted data in a single object
* By default it uses the AES-256 algorithm
